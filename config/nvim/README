ftplugin directory is for specific filetypes, similar to the init.vim file but only for specific files, the init.vim in in the main nvim directory is global i.e. for all filetypes.

UltiSnips directory also has the same specificity, this is a snippets directory that will only load snippets for specific filetypes.
